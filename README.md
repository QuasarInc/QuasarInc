- 👋 Hi, we're @QuasarInc and speciaslists in Business & Data Intelligence and advanced analytics
- 👀 Our interest is in extending existing BI and Analytics offerings and providing the best implementations, practices and solutions to our customers. We continue to develop "toolsets" around existing vendor offerings as they definitely lack the applications and features to ensure enterprise-grade sustainable and manageable solutions.
- 🌱 We're currently testing some much needed solutions for PowerBI (managed measures) as well as providing a framework that can supoport any BI tool and solution.
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on improving the basic foundations to providing succesful and correctly implemented BI and Analytics solutions
- 📫 you can contact us at our website www.quasarinc.com
